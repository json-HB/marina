    <h2>I haven’t received the OTP. What can be the reason?</h2>
    <p class="mr-b-50">
      The SMS is delivered by your network operator, so network issues can

      We decide the eligibility of every borrower based on our own set
      parameters and algorithms. Don’t worry if your loan did not get approved –
      it is not necessarily a reflection of your credit worthiness. Our loan
      assessment process is a function of multiple factors and in line with
      policies of our partners, in case you are rejected, you may re-apply later
      to review your status.
